# weibull_distribution
Melanoma till death or relapse data was used for this implementation.

## Parameters of Weibull
Newton-Raphson was conducted in order to find the parameters of the distribution.

## GLRT test
Later the Delta method was imployed to find the variance to perform a GLRT to find the significance of the parameters
